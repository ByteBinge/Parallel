for amdahls law, you need to know percentage of serial code blocks.
so you need to know how much time a serial section and a parallel section take.

start counting from the epoch - Jan 1st, midnight, 1970. Development of Unix OS.
returns back to you how long its been since then.

#include <sys/time.h>

in function, create object
struct timeval start;


call function gettimeofday(&start, NULL);
puts into the start variable, the time.

{ Then do you work here }
struct timeval end;
pass into the gettimeofday(&end, NULL);
